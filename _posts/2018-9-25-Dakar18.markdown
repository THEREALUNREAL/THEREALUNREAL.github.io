Dakar 18 is an open world racing game based on the real life rally sport of Dakar.

Me and my team were primarily tasked with creating the landscape of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, making extensive use of Google maps and photo references. The idea was to allow the pilots to get lost, just like in the actual event. For this reason it was important to work not only on path determined by the roadbook, but also a significant area around it.

I was also tasked with laying down the spline systems and other gameplay elements, such as checkpoints, mud/sand pits, roadbook elements in the world and other gamemode logic such as the treasure hunt.
