Commissioned work for an E-Sports org made in collaboration with my great friend _Johan "Birjolaxew" Fagerberg (programmer)_ and _Tom√°s Viegas (sound designer)_. This level is made to put the players aim and movement skills to the test. It's available on the Steam Workshop and it was played on XLGamesWorld in Lisbon during the 4 days of the event on the ASUS main stage.
