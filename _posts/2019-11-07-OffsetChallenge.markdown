Commissioned work for an E-Sports org made in collaboration with my great friend _Johan "Birjolaxew" Fagerberg (programmer)_ and _Tom√°s Viegas (sound designer)_. This level is made to put the players aim and movement skills to the test. It's available on the 
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909226147">Steam Workshop</a> and it was played on XLGamesWorld in Lisbon during the 4 days of the event on the ASUS main stage.
