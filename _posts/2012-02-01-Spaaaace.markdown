**KOTH_SPAAAACE** is a Team Fortress 2 King of the Hill space themed map.
It was created for the "Kepler 22-b Mapping Contest" where it placed 4th. Despite the -kind of- disapointing result I still consider it one the best experiences I had in mapping, for making me have to think out of the box. Definetely a challenging map for me at the time and I learned a bunch.
