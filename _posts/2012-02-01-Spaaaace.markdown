**KOTH_SPAAAACE** is a Team Fortress 2 King of the Hill map space themed as the name suggests. It was created for the "Kepler 22-b Mapping Contest" where it placed 4th. Despite the -kind of- disapointing result I still consider it one the best experiences I had in mapping, for having to think out of the box. Definetely a challenging map for me at the time and learned a bunch.
