This is a personal 3D project of mine created in Blender that I sculpted, retopologized, baked, textured and composed as a challenge for myself.
It was quite a good learning experience.

<font size="6">Workflow</font>
I started by sculpting the tree shape I was aiming to go for. I never intended to use it in a game, just as a show off piece, so I decided to model only the front part, and leave the back open if I wanted to complete it with some interior later.

After this I went ahead and rebuilt a low poly version of the tree, while being as loyal to the sculpture as possible.

Then I crossed my fingers and baked the highpoly mesh into the new one, it worked!

Then came the fun part, decorating! I decided to go with something between realistic and cartoon-ish. Some textures I used were downloaded from Poliigon others were just handmade.
I also decided to implement some more details to spice it up a bit.

Finally I created a fancy scene with light sources, added mist, composed and rendered the result, and here it is!

Hope you liked it.
