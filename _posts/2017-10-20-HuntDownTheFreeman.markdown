Worked with **Royal Rudius Entertainment** on "Hunt Down The Freeman". I was in charge of creating some of the levels of the game. The game was far from being a success, but it was a decent learning experience for me. I learned a lot about the game dev world and was fortunate enough to get a job on a different studio a few months before release of HDTF.
