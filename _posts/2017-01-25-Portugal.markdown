**DE_Portugal** is a CS:GO map inspired by my country's typical village architecture. It's a colorful map filled with lots of references to the portuguese culture.

It was by far my most well received map, counting with about 60,000 subscribers on the Steam Workshop and over 120,000 unique visitors.
