    <font size="6">Hey!</font> <p>I am a portuguese game developer named <b>Ricardo Sousa</b> with passion for creating game levels. For 2 years I attended University of Algarve, gathering experience and developing certain skills within the Animation field, but later decided to follow a more game design focused course in ETIC_Algarve.</p>
    <p>I started creating levels for Counter-Strike around 2006, and since then I've expanded my knowledge into other areas of game development such as animation, 3D modelling and programming.</p>
    <p>I've had the honor, and luck, of working with many talented people in various projects, remotely and locally; And I look forward to expand that list.</p>
