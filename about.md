<font size="6">Hey!</font> <p>My name is <b>Ricardo Sousa</b>, I'm from Portugal and I enjoy creating games. I like most areas of game design, but my biggest passion has always been to create levels! I've been to animation school for 2 years in University of Algarve, but later decided to follow a more game design focused course in ETIC_Algarve.</p>
<p>I started creating levels for Counter-Strike around 2006, since then I've expanded my knowledge into other areas of game development such as animation, 3D modelling and programming.</p>
<p>I've had the honor and luck of working with many talented people in various projects, remotely and locally.</p>
