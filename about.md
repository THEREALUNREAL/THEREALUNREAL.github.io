<font size="6">Hey!</font> <p>My name is <b>Ricardo Sousa</b>, I'm from Portugal and I enjoy creating games. I like most areas of game design, but my biggest passion has always been to create both fun and good looking levels! I've been to animation school for 2 years in University of Algarve, but later decided to follow a more game design focused course in ETIC_Algarve.</p>
<p>I enjoy both creating and playing games. I started creating levels for Counter-Strike around 2006, since then I've tried new games, new tools and expanded my knowledge into other areas of game development such as animation, 3D modelling and programming.</p>
  
  
  
  
<p>I'm also somewhat of a competitive guy and like to go on game related events such as gamejams, lan tournaments and love participating in level design contests!</p>
