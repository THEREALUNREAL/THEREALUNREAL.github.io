[![A picture of me](/images/me.jpg)](/images/me.jpg){: .portrait}

Hi, my name is Ricardo Sousa and I'm a college student in _Imagem Animada_ (animation) from Portugal. Back in 2007 I found myself wanting to create maps for Counter-Strike: Source, I had previously tried some other tools and sandbox games which I always enjoyed creating stuff in, but nothing gave me as much freedom as the SourceSDK. From there I grew up creating levels for various other games and mods, becoming really passionate and determined to learn more and more about 3D environments creation.
At the moment I focus on developing other skills such as Modelling and Photoshop, and would like to get into Programming soon to become a more complete artist in the world of 3D and Level Design.

So far I've won some mapping competitions some of which you can check out below.
