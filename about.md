[![A picture of me](/images/me.jpg)](/images/me.jpg){: .portrait}

Hi, my name is Ricardo Sousa and I'm a college student in _Imagem Animada_ (animation) from Portugal. Back in 2007 I found myself wanting to create maps for Counter-Strike: Source, I had previously tried some other tools and sandbox games which I always enjoyed creating stuff in, but nothing gave me as much freedom as the SourceSDK. From there I grew up creating levels for various other games and mods, becoming really passionate and determined to learn more and more about 3D environments creation. 
Now I try to enter in as many competitions as I can while devoloping some other projects on the side trying to hopefully get noticed and keep on improving as a Level Designer.
At the moment I focus on developing other skills such as Modelling and Photoshop, and would like to get into Programming soon.
